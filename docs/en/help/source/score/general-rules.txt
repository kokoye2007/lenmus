* Next step is to select a symbol from a palette by clicking on it with the mouse.


* Finally, move the mouse to the score, to the place where you would like the symbol to be added, and click on that point. In order to show you valid places to drop the selected object, different mouse cursors are used to guide the process. The mouse cursor ensures that you place symbols in meaningful locations and provide additional visual feedback about the action that is being performed.


* When you add music symbols to the score the program properly aligns and positions them according to standard music notation rules. Notes are beamed together or flagged, rests are added around notes, measures resized, etc. in order to get the music to fit properly.
