"The best way to use LenMus Phonascus is as a complement in your music "
"studies, to practise at home the concepts explained by a teacher at school. "
"Very often there is few time at school for doing exercises and the student "
"has to practise at home. But some exercises, specially those related to ear "
"training, are difficult to do at home without a teacher. It is in these "
"cases where LenMus can be of great help."

"It is important to make very clear that LenMus Phonascus can **never** "
"replace a good music teacher. While it can support and supplement music "
"teaching, LenMus **can not** replace the understanding and personal contact "
"of a real live teacher guiding your way. LenMus Phonascus is a great tool "
"for practising at home, specially in ear training, but a good teacher is "
"irreplaceable and will really accelerate your learning."

"If you can’t find or afford a teacher, LenMus Phonascus could help you to "
"learn music theory and develop your ear recognition abilities but, without a"
" teacher you should be extra critical of yourself. It’s easy to think you "
"know something when you don’t."

"The *General Exercises* book is oriented to help you in practising at home "
"the concepts explained at school. It is organised to allow you to quickly "

"on music theory."

"This book contains all available exercises in LenMus Phonascus. The "

"When you are having a teacher that explains you the theory, the *General "

"you are not taking music lessons this book could be of little help as it "

"Learning to read music (sight reading) requires many years of practise. "
"Reading music is not that hard, but it does take time, patience, and work. "

"The *Music Reading* books are graded and contains introductory texts so that"

"If you are studying without a teacher, you must follow the lessons in order."
" Once you have read the initial level 1 introductory lessons, the exercises "
"start. Take the lessons in order and work on them, one by one, practicing "
"the exercises until you master each lesson. Go at your own pace. Some "
"lessons may only take one or two days to master; many will take a week or "
"more. Just reading through a lesson doesn’t mean you’ve learned it. You need"
" to practice it ... a lot! The exercises in each lesson are designed to "
"force you to use also the rythms studied in previous lessons. Therefore, by "
"focussing on your current lesson you will be also reviewing all previous "
"learnt concepts. Each *Music Reading* book should take one academic year."

"To have more exercises to practise. Usually, when practising sight reading, "

"This book is not appropriate for studying without following a curriculum. "
"When you learn music, you don't learn everything about one topic and then "
