"If you are studying without a teacher, you must follow the lessons in order. "
"Once you have read the initial level 1 introductory lessons, the exercises "
"start. Take the lessons in order and work on them, one by one, practicing "
"the exercises until you master each lesson. Go at your own pace. Some "
"lessons may only take one or two days to master; many will take a week or "
"more. Just reading through a lesson doesn’t mean you’ve learned it. You need "
"to practice it ... a lot! The exercises in each lesson are designed to force "
"you to use also the rythms studied in previous lessons. Therefore, by "
"focussing on your current lesson you will be also reviewing all previous "
"learnt concepts. Each *Music Reading* book should take one academic year."

"To have more exercises to practise. Usually, when practising sight reading, "
"as the you have to read the same exercises several times, the exercises are "
"memorized and it becomes dificult to practise reading. *Music Reading* books "
"provides an unlimited source of exercises to practise. The scores for each "
"exercise are automatically composed by the program each time you press the "
"button 'new problem'. Therefore, the exercises never repeat."

"In the *Theory and Harmony* book you will find the theory lessons logically "
"organized by subject. I have tried to compile reference material on music "

"This book is not appropriate for studying without following a curriculum. "
"When you learn music, you don't learn everything about one topic and then "
"move on to the next one. Instead, you slowly learn a little of each topic at "
"each grade. In next grade, you review previous concepts and go deeper on the "
"subject. But the *Theory and Harmony* book is not splitted by grades. Each "
"topic is organised in lessons and you should stop advancing on a topic when "
"you have reached the requirements of the curriculum you are following."
