<para>
You know that in written music sound is indicated by using note symbols, and that
there exists a note symbol for each duration. In written music silence is also
indicated with symbols, called 'rests'. There also exists a rest for each note
duration. The following score shows a quarter note and the quarter rest:
</para>

<score>
    <music>
        (score (vers 1.5)
         (instrument
          (musicData (clef G)(key C)
            (time 2 4 noVisible)
            (spacer 20)(n a4 q)(r q)
            (barline end)
        )))
    </music>
</score>

<para>
In this lesson we will start reading music with scores composed just by quarter notes
and rests. These rhythms are very simple, as each note or rest gets a beat. Listen for
example to the following song:
</para>

<score>
    <control_play />
    <music>
        (score (vers 1.5)
         (instrument
          (musicData (clef G)(key C)
            (time 2 4)
            (n g4 q)(n e4 q)(barline)
            (n a4 q)(n f4 q)(barline)
            (n b4 q)(n g4 q)(barline)
            (n c5 q)(r q)(barline)
            (n c5 q)(n g4 q)(barline)
            (n c5 q)(r q)(barline end)
        )))

Now is your time to start reading music. Remember to mark the beats with your hand or
foot. Use also the metronome. The note range will be very limited (two first lines and
first space, notes E4, F4 and G4) to help you to memorize them. The range will be
broadened, progressively and slowly, in the following lessons.
