This eMusicBook is intended to help improve one's reading skills, providing the sort of practice and exercise that are required to become a good sight-reader.
</para>

<para>Apart of introducing different rhythmic cells of increasing complexity, the main concepts introduced in Level 1 are:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
    The stave. Treble (G) and bass (F) clefs. Names of notes on the stave.
    Extension of the stave to include two ledger lines below and above each stave.
</listitem>

<listitem>
    Note values of whole (semibreve), half (minim), quarter (crotchet), eighth (quaver)
    and sixteenth (semiquaver), and their equivalent rests. Tied notes. Single-dotted
    notes and rests.
</listitem>

<listitem>
    Simple time signatures of 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4 and compound time signature of 6/8.
    Bar-lines and the grouping of the notes listed above within these times.
</listitem>

<listitem>
    Key signatures of all major and minor keys up to and including two sharps and flats.

<title>Book organization</title>

<para>
This course has 31 lessons covering the following material:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><emphasis>Clefs and note ranges:</emphasis>
    The course starts with the G clef using a very reduced note range (e4-g4).
    Progressively, the note range is increased to reach the range c4-f5 in lesson 14.
    Next, the F key is introduced, again with a very reduced note range (a3-c4) and
    from there, the exercises of all following lessons use the F and G clef
    indistinctly. The note range is continuously being broadened in both clefs (G:
    a3-c6 y F: a2-e4), to cover two ledger lines, above and below.
</listitem>

<listitem><emphasis>Time signatures:</emphasis>
    In the first exercises (9 to 17) only the 2/4 simple time is used. Next, the 3/4
    simple time (lesson 18) and the 4/4 simple time (lesson 19) are used. In lesson 28
    the compound 6/8 is introduced and it is practiced in the remaining lessons (29 to
    31).
</listitem>

<listitem><emphasis>Key signatures:</emphasis>
    The exercises in the first two practical lessons (9 and 10) have scores using only
    the C major / A minor key signature (no accidentals). The key signature is introduced
    in lesson 13 and from there (lessons 14 to 17) the exercises use also one accidental
    (G major / E minor and F major / D minor). In the remaining lessons (18 to 31)
    exercises use up to two accidentals (D major / B minor and B flat major / G minor).

<title>Lessons' structure</title>

<para>
With exception of the first lessons, aimed at introducing the basic concepts of the
music notation, the remaining lessons are structured into three sections:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
In the first section the new concepts and rhythmic patterns introduced in the lesson are explained.
</listitem>

<listitem>
In the second section, optional, the new concepts are compared with known ones,
so that the student can better relate the new material and learn it.
</listitem>

<listitem>Finally, in the third section some exercises are proposed to practice
the newly introduced concepts.</listitem>
