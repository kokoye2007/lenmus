<title>The 2/4 time signature</title>

<para>
The first time signature we are going to use is the 2/4 time signature:
</para>

<score>
    <music>
        (score (vers 1.5)
         (instrument
          (musicData (clef G)(key C)
            (time 2 4)
            (barline end noVisible) )))
    </music>
</score>

<para>
As you know 2/4 means that each measure has two beats and that each beat gets a quarter
note. Therefore, each measure will get two quarter notes. For example:
</para>

<score>
    <control_play />
    <music>
        (score (vers 1.5)
         (instrument
          (musicData (clef G)(key C)
            (time 2 4)
            (n e4 q)(n g4 q)(barline simple)
            (n g4 q)(n a4 q)(barline simple)
            (n f4 q)(n c5 q)(barline end) )))
    </music>
</score>

<para>
We also know that the first beat of each measure is the stronger one. Therefore, if you
count beats along with the music, the 2/4 time signature will imply a rhythm such as
'ONE-and-Two-and-ONE-and-Two-and ...', stressing the ONE syllable, as if you were a
soldier marching. For studying music reading it makes sense to mark the beats with the
hand, the first beat of each measure with a knock down (on the table or in the air) and
the second beat of each measure with a knock up (in the air or on the shoulder). You
can also mark the beats with your foot, it you prefer, but it is very, very important
to mark the beats. You should make a habit out of it, at least until you get enough
skills at reading music.
