<title>The clef</title>

<para>
Sounds are represented by notes. There are seven notes named either using the first
seven letters of the alphabet A, B, C, D, E, F (Anglo-Saxon system) or using the names
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La and Si (Ti) (Latin system). To determine which pitch (sound)
is represented by each line and space in the staff a symbol, named 'the clef', is
placed at the beginning of each staff. In this course we are going to start with the
study of the G clef, also named 'treble clef', that is represented by the following
symbol:
</para>

<!-- Empty staff with a G clef -->
<score>
    <music>
        (score (vers 1.5)
         (instrument
          (musicData (clef G)(key C)
            (time 2 4 noVisible)
            (barline end noVisible) )))
    </music>
</score>


<para>The clef assigns a particular line to a specific pitch, and all other pitches
are mapped in ascending and descending order to the lines and spaces above and below
that reference line. In the G clef, the G note of the fourth octave is assigned to the
second line:
</para>

<!-- staff with a G clef -->
<score>
    <music>
        (score (vers 1.5)
         (instrument
          (musicData (clef G)(key C)
            (time 2 4 noVisible)
            (spacer 60)
            (text _''G'' dx:0 dy:-10)
            (n g4 w)
            (barline end noVisible)
        )))
    </music>
</score>

<para>
As a result, the staff lines and spaces get automatically assigned
to consecutive notes, as shown in the next score:

<!-- staff with a G clef and notes on all spaces and lines, with their names -->
