<h1>Αλλαγές στον LenMus Phonascus</h1>

<!-- =============================================================================== -->

<h2>LenMus Phonascus 5.6.0 (1 Μαρτίου, 2020)</h2>

<p> Ο κύριος στόχος της έκδοσης 5.6.0 είναι να αποφευχθούν προβλήματα που προκύπτουν με τον ήχο κατά την εγκατάσταση του
LenMus. Στις προηγούμενες εκδόσεις, ο χρήστης έπρεπε να διαμορφώσει τον συνθετητή MIDI και σε κάποιες
περιπτώσεις να τον εγκαταστήσει, και αυτό δημιουργούσε προβλήματα. Αυτό έχει λυθεί τώρα:</p>
<ul>
<li>Το LenMus περιλαμβάνει τώρα έναν προεπιλεγμένο εσωτερικό συνθέτη MIDI και, κατά συνέπεια, ο χρήστης
δεν χρειάζεται πλέον να εγκαταστήσει κάποιον συνθετητή MIDI  ή να διαμορφώσει το πρόγραμμα για να το χρησιμοποιήσει.</li>
<li> Ο βοηθός MIDI έχει αφαιρεθεί, αφού ο χρήστης δε χρειάζεται να ρυθμίσει τίποτα μετά την
        εγκατάσταση του LenMus. Για μεγαλύτερη ευελιξία, το  LenMus πλέον περιλαμβάνει μία επιλογή
       διαμόρφωσης MIDI, έτσι ώστε να  επιτέπει στο χρήστη να ρυθμίσει έναν εξωτερικό συνθετητή  (για παράδειγμα,
        αλλαγή SoundFont) ή να του επιτρέπει να χρησιμοποιεί έναν εξωτερικό συνθετητή MIDI αντί
        του εσωτερικού, σε περίπτωση που ο χρήστης επιθυμεί να χρησιμοποιήσει εξειδικευμένο υλικό ή κάποιον άλλο
        συνθετητή MIDI.</li>
    <li>Προστέθηκε σύνδεσμος στο παράθυρο καλωσορίσματος για τη διευκόλυνση των χρηστών ώστε να αναφέρουν σφάλματα και να κάνουν προτάσεις</li>
<li>Διορθώθηκε το σφάλμα που εμποδίζει τη μετάφραση του κουμπιού "Ακύρωση".</li>
<li>Διόρθωση σφάλματος: Τα ονόματα των οργάνων MIDI δεν έχουν μεταφραστεί σωστά κατά την αλλαγή της γλώσσας.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LenMus Phonascus 5.4 (September 26th, 2015)</h2>

<p>The main goal of this release is to simplify LenMus installation. I've changed the way
in which LenMus is built and installed, removing the dependency from Lomse library that
caused a lot of problems. Unfortunately, it is too costly to prepare a release without
including all the new code in development and, thus, this release includes a lot of new
features not yet finished, but this new code is, by default, disabled.
</p>
<p>The main changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Changes for including a score editor:
    <ul>
        <li>Changes in main menu:
	        <ul>
                <li>Added 'Edit' menu item, with some sub-items (undo, redo, insert,
	                enable edition). When opening a document it is, by default,
	                non-editable. You must enable edition by selecting 
	                'Edit > Enable edition'. Edit > Insert' includes test code for 
	                inserting headers, paragraphs and scores.
                </li>
                <li>Added more 'File' menu items:
	                <ul>
                        <li>'File > New', for creating empty documents.</li>
	                    <li>'File > Save' and 'File > Save as'.</li>
	                    <li>'File > Close'. Also, when closing a document, checks if it
                            has been modified and asks for saving it before closing.</li>
	                    <li>'File > Convert' menu item, for converting a Document to latest
                      format version.</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
	            <li>Added menu option 'View > Show voices in colors' for displaying
                    each voice in a different colour (works also in read only mode).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>More tools added:
	        <ul>
                <li>A 'Command console', to test edition commands without using GUI.</li>
                <li>A 'Toolbox' for containing all tools related to document edition:
	                <ul>
                        <li>It is automatically displayed/hidden if edition is enabled/disabled.
                        </li>
                        <li>It also admits 'mode' (personalized configurations so that
                            each exercise or edition mode can have specific tools).
                        </li>
                        <li>It is also automatically reconfigured when the active 
                            document changes, so that appropriate tools for each document
                            are presented.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A 'Score wizard' for creating scores from templates.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shortcuts: 
	        <ul>
                <li>Added code for a shortcuts system, globally managed.</li>
                <li>Added option dialog for customizing shortcuts.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All music elements (notes, rests, barlines, clefts, etc.) can
            be entered from keyboard. Navigation keys also operational.</li>
        <li>Support for edition via 'drag and click': Barlines notes and rests can now 
            be added by drag and click.
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Changes for preparing more exercises and new features:
    <ul>
        <li>Added and implemented FullEditorCtrol and DictationCtrol classes, for 
            allowing to use the score editor in music exercises.</li>
        <li>Added class ScoreComparer for correcting user solutions.</li>
        <li>Changes in composer for creating pickup measures (Thanks to Camilla Tassi).</li>
        <li>New dialog for metronome in 'Menu > Tools', to facilitate more features,
            such as setting tempo by tapping.</li>
        <li>Added help system. Help menu now includes: 'Users guide', 'Study guide'
            and 'Editor quick guide'.</li>
        <li>Added code for importing MusicXML files. Importing files merged in
            'File > Open'.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug in composer resulting in bad pitch assigned to some notes.</li>
        <li>Added button to hide or show TOC panel for books.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Other changes:
    <ul>
        <li>All the code has been updated for using wxWidgets 3.0.</li>
        <li>I've designed a new work-flow for translating the users oriented
            documentation, such as 'Users' Guide' and the 'Editor quick guide'.
            Several scripts developed for managing all this.</li>
        <li>Added option, in preferences dialog, for enabling all the features
            not yet finished ('Preferences > Other > Enable experimental features').</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- =============================================================================== -->

<h2>LenMus Phonascus 5.0 (July 8th, 2012)</h2>

<p>
Version 5.0 is, mainly, an experimental version using the new Lomse library (http://www.lenmus.org/en/lomse). It is an update of all LenMus Phonascus code, with some addidional improvements:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Two new exercises are included:
        <ul>
            <li>Notes identification.</li>
            <li>Tonality identification.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All existing problems with zooming, relative size of scores and text, and rendering have been solved</li>
    <li>The build system has been change to CMake. And there is now a Linux package.</li>
    <li>Now there are independent Windows installation packages for each translation. With this, it is now possible to update a translation at any moment without having to wait for a new program release. This creates more work for me but solves the previous problem of having to wait for all  translators before releasing a new version.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see there are no many new features, as all efforts has been in rewriting LenMus Phonascus code:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>All code related to analysing, parsing and rendering scores has been isolated and moved to a platform independent library (the Lomse library). The idea was that this code could be used by any other projects and that it can be better tested to get the best code quality.

    <li>The eBooks format has been changed so that now they are fully written in LDP.I have redesigned the way in which exercises are created and displayed. Now the LDP score description language has been extended so that it can now describe not only a score but full documents, with any content: texts, images, scores, exercises, etc.
    The reason for this change was to remove the need to use a web browser to display the eBooks. Until now, the exercises were displayed as HTML pages by using an internal, very limited, web browser. Due to its limitations and to the hacks I had to do to display scores, old LenMus Phonascus releases had some problems of difficult solution that are now solved.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
All these changes have implied a lot of work. Due to this, I have not yet finished rewritting all existing code. As a trade-off between features and time to release version 5.0, I've decided to release version 5.0 without including some features existing in previous 4.2 version:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The score editor is not yet included.</li>
    <li>Reduced functionality in some points:
        <ul>
            <li>Exercises supporting only exam mode (Quiz counter ctrol in exam mode).</li>
            <li>No right/wrong sound</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
All missing functionality will be restored gradually in future versions and new functionalities and exercises will be added.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>LenMus Phonascus 4.2.2 (March 21st, 2010)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Critical bug fixed in score renderization that could cause a crash in any score when rendering it.</li>
<li>Updated Basque translation</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<!-- =============================================================================== -->
<h2>LenMus Phonascus 4.2.1 (March 8th, 2010)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixes a critical bug producing a crash at start if monitor resolution is grater than 1024 x 768 pixels.</li>
<li>Language can now be changed without re-starting program</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<!-- =============================================================================== -->
<h2>LenMus Phonascus 4.2 (March 7th, 2010)</h2>


<p>The main changes introduced by release 4.2 are the following:</p>

<p><b>Exercises and eBooks</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Lessons in eBook TheoryHarmony: Added six lessons on scales, lesson on intervals changed.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Bug fixes</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Score layout algorithm has been rewritten from scratch using a test driven approach. A lot of renderization bugs have been fixed. Automated tests now in place for error detection and quality assurance.</li>
<li>Critical bug fixed: sometimes crash when clicking with mouse at end of last bar.</li>
<li>Inserting note before barline creates the note at next bar, with incorrect time position.</li>
<li>LDP parser incorrectly imported real numbers lower than 1.0 and greater than 0.0.</li>
<li>Clefs bounds incorrectly computed, adding more space than necessary for layout and for selection.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Translation</b></p>

<p>
In order to simplify and reduce work for translators, Langtool, the lenmus tool developed for eBooks translation, has been modified to improve it and to add support to translate also help documentation, release notes, web pages and other documents.
</p>

<p>
Also changes to improve program translation by not breaking sentences at certain tags (i.e. emphasis, link, etc); a lot of refactoring to simplify maintenance and addition of more tags. Support for styles (eBook style, variable footers) introduced.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<!-- =============================================================================== -->
<h2>LenMus Phonascus 4.1 (January 7th, 2010)</h2>


<p>The main changes introduced by release 4.1 are the following:</p>

<p><b>The score editor</b></p>
<p>
The score editor is much more stable but it is not yet finished and continues in beta status. The editor includes now more features but few of them will be noticeable in this release. The most visible are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Data entry using the mouse</b>. The user interface (including the toolbox) has been improved and now data entry using the mouse (point and click) is available. Data entry using keyboard has been restricted to notes and rests (but mouse can also be used). For all other, the mouse is now mandatory.
</li>

<li><b>Lines, ties, and, in general, geometric figures, are now editable by dragging control points</b>.
</li>

<li><b>Figured bass symbols</b>. Now it is possible to add figured bass annotations to the score. This was required for the planned exercises on figured bass to be included in a coming version.
</li>

<li><b>Notes stem direction now editable</b>. The tool box now includes buttons to control stem direction.
</li>

<li><b>The score being edited is now automatically recovered after a crash</b>. The score editor is much more stable, as a lot of debugging was done and all known bugs have been fixed; nevertheless, it is still not finished and continues in beta status. But now, after a program crash you will not loose (normally) the score being edited and it will be recovered automatically when you run again the program.
</li>

<li><b>Automatic upload of a 'forensic log'</b>. I need your help to debug the score editor. Take into account that most of my time is devoted to programming, not to use the program. Therefore you probably will catch more errors than me!. In order that you can collaborate in this task, the program now saves data about the score being edited and the action performed, and if the program crashes, it asks for your permission and sends me a "forensic log". It is a simple file, in text format (you can open it at see its contents) and it does not contains any identification data of any nature (personal, equipment, Internet address, etc). It only has the score being edited an the actions being performed. Thanks for your collaboration!
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Among the 'hidden' improvements the following should be mentioned:
<ul>
<li><b>Support for 'Score processors'</b>. There is a need for tools to process (or alter) a full score. For example, a tool to transpose a score, to add colours to voices, to make a piano reduction, etc. I call 'score processors' to these type of tools that process the whole score and can alter it. Support to develop and use score processors has been added and it is currently being tested with the four voices harmony and figured bass exercises that will be included in coming releases.
</li>

<li><b>Support to use the score editor for exercises</b>. The problem is presented as a score that the student has to modify. As the full editor is used, the student can save the score so that he/she can later continue the exercise. This facility is currently being tested with the harmony and figured bass exercises.</li>

<li><b>Customizable editor modes</b>. For exercises using the score editor to elaborate the answer (for example: dictation exercises, harmony exercises, etc.) there is a need to customize the score editor for the needs of a particular exercise. For example, in the four-parts harmony exercises the editor is restricted to use only four voices. To implement this idea, the score editor now supports 'editor modes'. An 'editor mode' is just a set of restrictions and customizations that forces the score editor to behave in a predefined way and customizes the toolbox to include different tools.
</li>

</ul>
</p>



<p><b>Exercises and eBooks</b></p>

<p>
<b>The interval's exercise has been reviewed and splitted into two exercises</b>, one to identify intervals and another one to build them. The identification exercise has been re-structured into four difficulty levels. The exercise settings has been rebuild and there are now more options.
</p>

<p>
eBook Theory & harmony now includes <b>a new chapter on intervals</b>. But only the first lesson is included. Sorry! I have no more time!
</p>

<p>
The <b>eBooks license has been changed to Creative Commons Attributtion-Share Alike License</b>. I think this license is clearer than the GNU Free Documentation License and is compatible with it. This changes also simplifies life for using texts from other free public sources or for integrating LenMus texts in other public sources.
</p>


<p>
<b>The <i>Leitner</i> learning methodology is now included in some exercises.</b>
Originally, LenMus exercises were not based on any particular learning methodology. Questions were selected just at random and no student performance data was saved. Version 4.1 now includes support in some exercises for a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank">spaced repetition</a>
learning technique, also known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard" target="_blank">Leitner method</a> or flashcards method.
A database to save user data about exercises and answers has already been added and I have started to modify exercises to include four working modes: 'learning', 'practising', 'exam' and 'quiz'</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 'learning' mode the program analyses your answers and schedule questions to systematically covering all the subject and to focus on those questions that are troubling you. This mode is the most systematic one and asked questions are adapted your learning needs, to minimize your study time and optimise your learning rate. Your performance data is saved and the next time  you return again to the exercise, the program takes care of asking questions to ensure an optimal learning path. The result is, ideally, a reduction in the amount of time needed to study a subject and the assurance that the subject has been systematically reviewed. This mode is based on the 'spaced repetition' or 'Leitner method'.</li>

  <li>In 'practising' mode the program uses your performance data, saved in learning mode, to choose questions. It selects questions at random but giving more probability to those that are troubling you. Your performance data in this mode is not saved. This mode is useful when you have finished your daily assignment and you would like to practise more.</li>

  <li>In 'exam' mode, neither your saved performance data not your answers to previous questions are taken into account to formulate the next question. At any moment, all possible questions have the same probability of being asked. This mode is useful for testing your knowledge before taking an examination, but is less useful for learning.
  </li>

  <li>The 'quiz' mode is similar to the 'exam' mode but two answer counters are displayed and questions are accounted in both counters: one in first counter and the next one in the second counter. This mode is useful to work in pairs or in teams at classroom.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>User requests and other changes</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Some users requested to have a <b>count off before starting any score play back</b>. Count off has been added for scores opened in the editor and for scores in music reading exercises.</li>
<li>I received some reports on problems when using low screen resolutions or big size icons in the toolbar, as the buttons didn't fit on the available space and some of them were not visible on the screen; as the actions performed with these buttons were not available on the main menu the user could not interact with the program. Now:
    <ul>
    <li><b>all toolbar actions are also on the main menu</b>, and</li>
    <li><b>the toolbar automatically resizes and splits to fit in the main window</b>.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>LenMus Phonascus 4.0 (January 17th, 2009)</h2>

As the version number change suggests,
release 4.0 is major update in the program code and functionality. The main changes are:<p>

<p><b>Inclusion of a score editor (beta status)</b></p>

<p>The major change from previous release 3.6 is the inclusion of a score editor
(although in beta status).
The score editor is not yet finished, as much more features have to be added, but
the included
features are operational, and allows to create simple scores, even with several
instruments and voices. Nevertheless, the editor is in a preliminary state (beta
status) and it is mainly useful deal with simple scores with one
voice per staff. Many voices per staff are also supported but facilities to automate
layouting task and taking automated decisions, such as automatic voice assignment,
automatically setting up stem direction in notes to avoid
collisions between stems, and other facilities, are not
fully operational and in some cases produce poor results.
Also, at current development
stage, it is not possible to deal with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lyric lines</li>
  <li>slurs</li>
  <li>dynamics, articulations and other symbols</li>
  <li>cue/grace notes</li>
  <li>rehearsal marks, coda, segno and related symbols</li>
  <li>nested tuples</li>
  <li>figures: lines, boxes, circles, other</li>
</ul>

<p>These missing features will be added in coming releases. The basements are
now there, so I expect to add much more features in short time.</p>

<p>One of the issues that has demanding me a lot of time is the user interface.
I would like to find a simple and intuitive interface, but the complexities
involved in editing a score makes this difficult to achieve. Therefore,
do not assume the user interface is finished as I will continue experimenting
with different approaches. Your suggestions are extremely welcome,
specially if you have experience in using other score editors.
</p>



<p><b>Change of license to GPL v3+</p></b>

<p>The extensive code re-writing required to include the score editor and the
fact that including a score editor is a major change in program features are
the main reasons to change release number to 4.0 instead of 3.7.</p>

<p>With release 4.0 I also have changed the program license to the new Free
Software Foundation GPL V3+. With this change, I expect to better ensure
your rights to use LenMus for free, to have access to source code, and to be
able to distribute it to others and to modify it. The change to GPL v3+ is
also a reason to change the release number to 4.0. With this change it will
be more identifiable which license applies to which lenmus version:</p>
<ul>
    <li>lenmus 1.x - freeware. Source code not available</li>
    <li>lenmus 2.x & 3.x - GPL v2+</li>
    <li>lenmus 4.x - GPL v3+</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Welcome page</p></b>

<p>A welcome page has been added to facilitate access to the different features and to
have easily available on startup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>eBooks</li>
  <li>The score editor</li>
  <li>Latest open scores</li>
  <li>Useful links and documentation</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Other changes</p></b>

<p>Version 4.0 does not include new music eBooks or exercises. But bugs
detected in previous versions have been fixed.</p>

<p>Three new translations has been added: Basque, Galician and Italian.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Improvements in the automatic music composer:<ul>
          <li>The composer was modified so that in the final measure it never adds a note longer that a quarter note if the composed piece only uses quarter notes. This was needed for Music Reading Level 1 eBook, for the initial lessons.</li>
        </ul></li>
  <li>Improvements in the internal score model to support more features:<ul>

          <li>Option 'Staff.DrawLeftBarline' to control left barline drawing.</li>
          <li>Option 'StaffLines.Hide' to control staff lines drawing.</li>
          <li>Option 'StaffLines.StopAtFinalBarline' to allow for staff lines
            going to the right paper margin instead of finishing at the final
            barline.</li>
          <li>Option 'Staff.UpperLegerLines.Displacement' to shift the first upper leger
            line so that it is closer/further than normal spacing.
            The other leger lines spacing is not changed.</li>
        <li>Options 'Render.SpacingMethod' and 'Render.SpacingValue', to allow for

    </ul></li>
  <li>Improvements in score renderization:
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed spacing method implemented.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug [#1715968]. Proportional spacing of notes is now working.</li>

            in aural training compare intervals exercise.</li>
      <li>Bug fixed [#1715979]: When you have a score open, the 'show/hide navigation panel'
            button shows as active but you cannot click on it.</li>

            labels. The English text has the same letter as quick key for bottom
